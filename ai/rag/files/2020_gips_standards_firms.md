CFA Institute is a global not-for-profit association of investment professionals with the mission of
leading the investment profession globally by setting the highest standards of ethics, education,
and professional excellence. CFA Institute has a longstanding history of commitment to establish-
ing and supporting the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). The GIPS standards
are ethical standards for calculating and presenting investment performance based on the princi-
ples of fair representation and full disclosure.

The GIPS standards are the recognized standard for calculating and presenting investment per-
formance around the world. Compliance with the GIPS standards has become a firm’s “passport”
to market investment management services globally. Asset owners that comply demonstrate a
commitment to adhering to global best practices. As of June 2019, CFA Institute has partnered
with organizations in more than 40 countries and regions that contribute to the development and
promotion of the GIPS standards.

##### History

- • In 1995, CFA Institute, formerly known as the Association for Investment Management andResearch (AIMR), sponsored and funded the Global Investment Performance Standards
Committee to develop global standards for calculating and presenting investment perfor-
mance, based on the existing AIMR Performance Presentation Standards (AIMR-PPS®).

- • The first Global Investment Performance Standards were published in April 1999. That year,the Global Investment Performance Standards Committee was replaced by the Investment
Performance Council (IPC) to further develop and promote the GIPS standards. The develop-
ment of the GIPS standards was a global industry initiative with participation from individuals
and organizations from more than 15 countries.

- • The IPC was charged with developing provisions for other asset classes (e.g., real estate andprivate equity) and addressing other performance-related issues (e.g., fees and advertising)
to broaden the scope and applicability of the GIPS standards. The second edition of the GIPS
standards, published in February 2005, accomplished this goal.

- • With the 2005 edition release and the growing adoption and expansion of the GIPS standards,the IPC decided to move to a single global investment performance standard that would elim-
inate the need for local variations of the GIPS standards. All country-specific performance
standards converged with the GIPS standards, resulting in 25 countries adopting a single,
global standard for the calculation and presentation of investment performance.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
- • In 2005, with the convergence of country-specific versions to the GIPS standards and theneed to reorganize the governance structure to facilitate involvement from GIPS Standards
Sponsors, CFA Institute dissolved the IPC and created the GIPS Executive Committee and the
GIPS Council. The GIPS Executive Committee served as the decision-making authority for
the GIPS standards, and the GIPS Council facilitated the involvement of all GIPS Standards
Sponsors in the ongoing development and promotion of the GIPS standards.

- • In 2008, the GIPS Executive Committee began a review of the GIPS standards in an effort tofurther refine the provisions. The GIPS Executive Committee collaborated closely with its
technical subcommittees, specially formed working groups, and GIPS Standards Sponsors.
These groups reviewed the existing provisions and guidance and conducted surveys and other
research in the effort to produce the 2010 edition of the GIPS standards.

- • In 2017, the GIPS Executive Committee concluded that the GIPS standards should betteraccommodate the needs of managers of pooled funds and alternative investments, as well as
firms focusing on high-net-worth clients. In 2017, a Consultation Paper, which described the
proposed key concepts of the GIPS standards and requested feedback on specific issues, was
issued for public comment. The public comments received generally supported the proposed
concepts. Subsequently, the 2020 GIPS Standards Exposure Draft was released on 31 August
2 018. The final version of the 2020 edition of the GIPS standards was issued on 30 June 2019.

- • The GIPS standards were originally created for investment firms managing composite strat-egies, with a focus on how firms present performance of composites to prospective clients.
Asset owners, who were always able to claim compliance if they had discretion over their
assets, struggled to understand how the GIPS standards applied to them. To address asset
owners’ needs, in 2014 the Guidance Statement on the Application of the GIPS Standards to
Asset Owners was issued. This Guidance Statement explained how the requirements of the
GIPS standards did or did not apply to asset owners. In the 2020 edition, separate provisions
were created so that firms and asset owners each have provisions designed for them. Firms
and those asset owners that market their services must follow the GIPS Standards for Firms.
Asset owners that do not market their services will follow the GIPS Standards for Asset
Owners. The GIPS Standards for Verifiers explain the procedures a verifier must follow when
conducting a verification or performance examination.

##### Preamble—Why Is a Global Investment Performance
##### Standard Needed?

**Standardize Investment Performance:** Financial markets and the investment management
industry have become increasingly global in nature. The growth in the types and number of finan-
cial entities, the globalization of the investment process, and the increased competition among
investment management firms all demonstrate the need to standardize the calculation and presen-
tation of investment performance.

**Global Passport:** Asset managers and both existing and prospective clients benefit from an
established global standard for calculating and presenting investment performance. Investment
practices, regulation, performance measurement, and reporting of performance vary considerably
from country to country. By adhering to a global standard, firms in countries with minimal or no
investment performance standards can compete for business on an equal footing with firms from
countries with more-developed standards. Firms from countries with established practices can
have more confidence in being fairly compared with local firms when competing for business in
countries that have not previously adopted performance standards. Performance standards that
are accepted globally enable investment firms to measure and present their investment perfor-
mance so that investors can readily compare investment performance among firms.

**Investor Confidence:** Organizations that adhere to investment performance standards help
assure investors and beneficiaries that the firm’s and the asset owner’s investment performance is
complete and fairly presented. Both prospective and existing clients of investment firms as well as
asset owner oversight bodies benefit from a global investment performance standard by having a
greater degree of confidence in the performance information presented to them.

##### Mission and Objectives

The mission of the GIPS standards is to promote ethics and integrity and instill trust through the
use of the GIPS standards by achieving universal demand for compliance by asset owners, adop-
tion by asset managers, and support from regulators for the ultimate benefit of the global invest-
ment community.

The objectives of the GIPS standards are as follows:

- • Promote investor interests and instill investor confidence.

- • Ensure accurate and consistent data.
<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
- • Obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for calculating and presenting performance.

- • Promote fair, global competition among investment firms.

- • Promote industry self-regulation on a global basis.
##### Overview

Key concepts of the GIPS standards that apply to firms include the following:

- • The GIPS standards are ethical standards for investment performance presentation to ensurefair representation and full disclosure of investment performance.

- • Meeting the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure is likely to require more thansimply adhering to the minimum requirements of the GIPS standards. Firms should also
adhere to the recommendations to achieve best practice in the calculation and presentation of
performance.

- • Firms must comply with all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards, including anyGuidance Statements, interpretations, and Questions & Answers (Q&As) published by
CFA Institute and the GIPS standards governing bodies.

- • The GIPS standards do not address every aspect of performance measurement and willcontinue to evolve over time to address additional areas of investment performance.

- • The GIPS standards require firms to create and maintain composites for all strategies forwhich the firm manages segregated accounts or markets to segregated accounts. Firms must
include all actual, fee-paying, discretionary segregated accounts in at least one composite
defined by investment mandate, objective, or strategy. Pooled funds must also be included
in any composite for which the pooled fund meets the composite definition. Firms must
maintain and make available information about all of the strategies they manage using com-
posites or pooled funds. These requirements prevent firms from cherry-picking their best
performance.

- • The GIPS standards rely on the integrity of input data, the quality of which is critical to cre-ating accurate performance presentations. The underlying valuations of portfolio holdings
drive performance. It is essential for these and other inputs to be accurate. The GIPS standards
require firms to adhere to certain calculation methodologies to allow for comparability across
firms.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>##### Historical Performance Record

A firm is required to initially present, at a minimum, five years of annual investment performance
that is compliant with the GIPS standards. If the composite or pooled fund has been in existence
less than five years, the firm must present performance since the composite or pooled fund incep-
tion date. Prospectively, the firm must present an additional year of performance each year, build-
ing up to a minimum of 10 years of GIPS-compliant performance.

Firms may link non-GIPS-compliant performance to their GIPS-compliant performance provided
that only GIPS-compliant performance is presented for periods after the minimum effective com-
pliance date, which differs depending on the asset type:

- • 1 January 2006 for real estate and private equity composites and pooled funds, as well as wrapfee composites.

- • 1 January 2000 for all other composites and pooled funds.
##### Claiming Compliance and Verification

Firms must take all steps necessary to ensure that they have satisfied all the applicable require-
ments of the GIPS standards before claiming compliance. Firms are strongly encouraged to per-
form periodic internal compliance checks. Implementing adequate internal controls during all
stages of the investment performance process—from data input to preparing GIPS Composite
Reports and GIPS Pooled Fund Reports—instills confidence in the validity of performance pre-
sented as well as in the claim of compliance.

Firms may choose to have an independent third-party verification. Verification is a process by
which a verification firm (verifier) conducts testing of a firm on a firm-wide basis in accordance
with the required verification procedures of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance
on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance,
as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed
in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. The
value of verification is widely recognized, and being verified is considered to be best practice. It is
strongly recommended that firms be verified. In addition to verification, firms may also choose to
have specifically focused testing of a composite or pooled fund (performance examination) per-
formed by an independent third-party verifier to provide additional assurance regarding the per-
formance of a particular composite or pooled fund.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>##### Implementing a Global Standard

One objective of the GIPS standards is to obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for
the calculation and presentation of investment performance in a fair and comparable format that
provides full disclosure. To facilitate the implementation of the GIPS standards, CFA Institute,
together with the GIPS standards governing bodies, creates and administers the GIPS standards
while local GIPS Standards Sponsors help to promote them.

Countries without an investment performance standard are strongly encouraged to promote the
GIPS standards as the local standard and translate them into the local language when necessary.
Although the GIPS standards may be translated into many languages, if a discrepancy arises, the
English version of the GIPS standards is the official governing version.

The self-regulatory nature of the GIPS standards necessitates a strong commitment to ethical integ-
rity. Self-regulation also assists regulators in exercising their responsibility for ensuring the fair dis-
closure of information within financial markets. Regulators are encouraged to do the following:

- • Recognize the benefit of voluntary compliance with standards that represent global bestpractices;

- • Consider taking enforcement action against firms that falsely claim compliance with the GIPSstandards; and

- • Recognize the value of and encourage independent third-party verification.
Where existing laws, regulations, or industry standards already impose requirements related to
the calculation and presentation of investment performance, firms are strongly encouraged to
comply with the GIPS standards in addition to applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance
with applicable laws and regulations does not necessarily lead to compliance with the GIPS
standards. In cases in which laws and/or regulations conflict with the GIPS standards, firms are
required to comply with the laws and regulations and make full disclosure of the conflict in the
GIPS Report.

##### GIPS Standards Sponsors

The presence of a local GIPS Standards Sponsor is essential for effective implementation of the
GIPS standards and ongoing support within a country or region. Working in partnership with
CFA Institute, GIPS Standards Sponsors play a key role in promoting the GIPS standards globally.
GIPS Standards Sponsors, composed of one or more industry organizations, provide an import-
ant link between their local markets and the GIPS standards governing bodies. In addition to
delivering educational programs and promoting the GIPS standards across the local investment
profession, the GIPS Standards Sponsors own any CFA Institute-approved translation of the
GIPS standards materials and are responsible for protecting it.

The 2020 Edition of the GIPS Standards has three chapters:

1. GIPS Standards for Firms

1. GIPS Standards for Asset Owners

1. GIPS Standards for Verifiers
Organizations that compete for business must comply with the GIPS Standards for Firms.

The GIPS Standards for Firms are divided into the following eight sections:

1 **)** **Fundamentals of Compliance:** Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS
standards, including properly defining the firm, providing GIPS Reports to all prospective
clients and prospective pooled fund investors, adhering to applicable laws and regulations,
and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. Two important issues that
a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are the definition
of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. The definition of the firm is the foundation
for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm assets can be
determined. The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios
must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement its investment
strategies.

2 **)** **Input Data and Calculation Methodology:** Consistency of input data used to calculate
performance is critical to effective compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the
foundation for full, fair, and comparable investment performance presentations. Achieving
comparability among investment management firms’ performance presentations requires uni-
formity in methods used to calculate returns. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain
calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability.

3 **)** **Composite and Pooled Fund Maintenance:** A composite is an aggregation of one or more
portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The
composite return is the asset-weighted average of the performance of all portfolios in the com-
posite. Creating meaningful composites is essential to the fair presentation, consistency, and
comparability of performance over time and among firms. Pooled funds must be included in
composites if they meet a composite definition.

**Reporting Sections:** These four sections detail the requirements and recommendations for
reporting the following types of returns:

4 **)** **Composite Time-Weighted Return Report**

5 **)** **Composite Money-Weighted Return Report**

6 **)** **Pooled Fund Time-Weighted Return Report**

7 **)** **Pooled Fund Money-Weighted Return Report.**

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Each of the four reporting sections is self-contained and includes requirements and recom-
mendations relevant to that particular report. Firms must include the information from the
respective section depending on whether they are preparing a composite or a pooled fund
report, as well as on whether time-weighted returns or money-weighted returns are included.

After constructing the composites, gathering the input data, and calculating returns, the firm
must incorporate this information in GIPS Reports based on the requirements in the GIPS
standards for presenting investment performance. No finite set of requirements can cover all
potential situations or anticipate future developments in investment industry structure, tech-
nology, products, or practices. When appropriate, firms have the responsibility to include in
GIPS Reports information not addressed by the GIPS standards.

Disclosures allow firms to elaborate on the data provided in the presentation and give the
reader the proper context in which to understand the performance. To comply with the GIPS
standards, firms must disclose certain information in all GIPS Reports regarding their perfor-
mance and the policies adopted by the firm. Although some disclosures are required for all
firms, others are specific to certain circumstances and may not be applicable in all situations.
Firms are not required to make negative assurance disclosures (e.g., if the firm does not use
leverage in a particular composite strategy, no disclosure of the use of leverage is required).
One of the essential disclosures for every firm is the claim of compliance. Once a firm meets
all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards, it must appropriately use the claim of
compliance to indicate compliance with the GIPS standards. Firms are also required to submit
a GIPS Compliance Notification Form to CFA Institute when they initially claim compliance
and on an annual basis thereafter.

8 **)** **GIPS Advertising Guidelines:** Firms are not required to follow the GIPS Advertising
Guidelines when creating an advertisement, but if they would like to claim compliance with
the GIPS standards in an advertisement, they must adhere to the GIPS Advertising Guidelines
or include a GIPS Report.

**Glossary:** Words appearing in small capital letters in Sections 1–8 are defined terms.
The Glossary includes a description of each defined term.

**Appendices:** The appendices include samples of GIPS Reports, lists of composites and pooled
fund descriptions, and GIPS Advertisements.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>## EFFECTIVE DATE

The effective date for the 2020 edition of the GIPS standards is 1 January 2020. GIPS Reports that
include performance for periods ending on or after 31 December 2020 must be prepared in accor-
dance with the 2020 edition of the GIPS standards. Prior editions of the GIPS standards may be
found on the CFA Institute website (www.cfainstitute.org).

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||><||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>## 1. FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPLIANCE

##### 1.A. Fundamentals of Compliance—Requirements

1. A.1The GIPS standards must be applied on a firm-wide basis. Compliance must be met on a
firm-wide basis and cannot be met on a composite, pooled fund, or portfolio basis.

1. A.2The firm must be defined as an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to the
public as a distinct business entity.

1. A.3To initially claim compliance with the GIPS standards, the firm must attain compliance
for a minimum of five years or for the period since the firm inception if the firm has been
in existence for less than five years.

1. A.4The firm must comply with all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards,
including any Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Questions & Answers (Q&As)
published by CFA Institute and the GIPS standards governing bodies.

1. A.5The firm must:

a. Document its policies and procedures used in establishing and maintain-
ing compliance with the requirements of the GIPS standards, as well as any
recommendations it has chosen to adopt, and apply them consistently.

b. Create policies and procedures to monitor and identify changes and additions to all of
the Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Q&As published by CFA Institute and
the GIPS standards governing bodies.

1. A.6The firm must:

a. Comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the calculation and presen-
tation of performance.

b. Create policies and procedures to monitor and identify changes and additions to laws
and regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance.

1. A.7The firm must not present performance or performance-related information
that is false or misleading. This requirement applies to all performance or perfor-
mance-related information on a firm-wide basis and is not limited to those mate-
rials that reference the GIPS standards. The firm may provide any performance or
performance-related information that is specifically requested by a prospective
client or prospective investor for use in a one-on-one presentation.

1. A.8If the firm does not meet all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards, the
firm must not represent or state that it is “in compliance with the Global Investment
Performance Standards except for...” or make any other statements that may indicate com-
pliance or partial compliance with the GIPS standards.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
1. A.9Statements referring to the calculation methodology as being “in accordance,” “in compli-
ance,” or “consistent” with the Global Investment Performance Standards, or similar state-
ments, are prohibited.

1. A.10The firm must not make statements referring to the performance of a current client
or pooled fund investor as being “calculated in accordance with the Global Investment
Performance Standards,” except for when a GIPS-compliant firm reports the performance
of a segregated account to current clients or a pooled fund to current investors.

1. A.11The firm must make every reasonable effort to provide a gips composite report to all
prospective clients when they initially become prospective clients. The firm must
not choose to which prospective clients it presents a gips composite report.

1. A.12Once the firm has provided a gips composite report to a prospective client, the
firm must provide an updated gips composite report at least once every 12 months if
the prospective client is still a prospective client.

1. A.13The firm must make every reasonable effort to provide a gips report to all limited
distribution pooled fund prospective investors when they initially become
prospective investors. The gips report may be either:

a. A gips pooled fund report, or

b. A gips composite report. A gips composite report may be provided only if the
limited distribution pooled fund is included in the respective composite.

The firm must not choose to which limited distribution pooled fund
prospective investors it presents a gips report.

1. A.14Once the firm has provided a gips pooled fund report or a gips composite report
to a limited distribution pooled fund prospective investor, the firm must
provide an updated gips pooled fund report or gips composite report at least once
every 12 months if the limited distribution pooled fund prospective investor is
still a limited distribution pooled fund prospective investor.

1. A.15The firm may provide a gips pooled fund report or a gips composite report that
includes the broad distribution pooled fund to broad distribution pooled
fund prospective investors but is not required to do so.

1. A.16When providing gips reports to prospective clients and prospective investors,
the firm must update these reports to include information through the most recent
annual period end within 12 months of that annual period end.

1. A.17The firm must be able to demonstrate how it made every reasonable effort to provide:

a. A gips composite report to those prospective clients required to receive a
gips composite report.

b. A gips pooled fund report or gips composite report to those limited
distribution pooled fund prospective investors required to receive a
gips pooled fund report or gips composite report.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
1. A.18A composite benchmark used in a gips composite report must reflect the invest-
ment mandate, objective, or strategy of the composite. The firm must not use a price-
only benchmark in a gips composite report.

1. A.19A pooled fund benchmark used in a gips pooled fund report must reflect the
investment mandate, objective, or strategy of the pooled fund. The firm must not use
a price-only benchmark in a gips pooled fund report.

1. A.20The firm must correct material errors in gips composite reports and must:

a. Provide the corrected gips composite report to the current verifier.

b. Provide the corrected gips composite report to current clients and any former ver-
ifiers that received the gips composite report that had the material error.

c. Make every reasonable effort to provide the corrected gips composite report to all
current prospective clients and prospective investors that received the gips
composite report that had the material error. The firm is not required to
provide the corrected gips composite report to former clients, former investors,
former prospective clients, or former prospective investors.

1. A.21The firm must correct material errors in gips pooled fund reports and must:

a. Provide the corrected gips pooled fund report to the current verifier.

b. Provide the corrected gips pooled fund report to current investors and any former
verifiers that received the gips pooled fund report that had the material error.

c. Make every reasonable effort to provide the corrected gips pooled fund report to
all current prospective investors that received the gips pooled fund report
that had the material error. The firm is not required to provide the corrected
gips composite report to former investors or former prospective investors.

1. B.4The firm should adopt the broadest, most meaningful definition of the firm. The scope
of this definition should include all geographical (country, regional, etc.) offices operating
under the same brand name, regardless of the actual name of the individual investment
management company.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
1. B.5The firm should provide to each current client, on an annual basis, a gips composite
report of the composite in which the client’s portfolio is included.

tor, on an annual basis, a gips pooled fund report of the limited distribution
pooled fund in which the investor is invested.

1. B.7If the firm is selling participation in a new limited distribution pooled fund that
does not yet have a track record, the firm should present the most appropriate track
record for the new limited distribution pooled fund, if available. The most appro-
priate track record is a gips report for a composite or another pooled fund that is
managed according to the same or similar strategy as the new limited distribution
pooled fund.

1. B.4The firm should accrue investment management fees.

1. B.5Returns should be calculated net of non-reclaimable withholding taxes on dividends,
interest, and capital gains. Reclaimable withholding taxes should be accrued.

1. B.6The firm should incorporate the following hierarchy into its policies and procedures for
determining fair value for portfolio investments on a composite-specific or pooled
fund–specific basis.

a. Investments must be valued using objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market
prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date, if avail-
able. If such prices are not available, then investments should be valued using;

b. Objective, observable quoted market prices for similar investments in active mar-
kets. If such prices are not available or appropriate, then investments should be
valued using;

c. Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active (mar-
kets in which there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are not current,
or price quotations vary substantially over time and/or between market makers).
If such prices are not available or appropriate, then investments should be valued
based on;

d. Market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment.
If such inputs are not available or appropriate, then investments should be valued
based on;

27 Required for periods beginning on or after 1 October 2012.

28 Required for money-weighted returns for periods ending on or after 31 December 2020.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>e. Subjective, unobservable inputs for the investment where markets are not active at
the measurement date. Unobservable inputs should be used to measure fair value
only when observable inputs and prices are not available or appropriate. Unobservable
inputs reflect the firm’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market partic-
ipants would use in pricing the investment and should be developed based on the
best information available under the circumstances.

1. B.7The firm should use gross-of-fees returns when calculating risk measures.

1. B.8Private market investments should have an external valuation at least once
every 12 months.

that was created solely to include one or more pooled funds if the composite is not
representative of the firm’s strategy offered as a segregated account.

client-directed changes to a portfolio’s investment mandate, objective, or strategy or
the redefinition of the composite make it appropriate. The historical performance of

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>the portfolio must remain with the original composite. Portfolios must not be
moved into or out of composites as a result of the firm’s tactical changes.

1. A.11If the firm sets a minimum asset level for portfolios to be included in a composite,
the firm:

a. Must not include portfolios below the composite-specific minimum asset level
in that composite.

b. Must not apply retroactively any changes to that composite-specific minimum
asset level.

1. A.12A firm that removes portfolios from composites because of significant cash
flows must define “significant” on an ex ante, composite-specific basis and must
consistently follow the composite-specific policy.

1. A.14The firm must include the performance record of actual wrap fee portfolios in
appropriate composites in accordance with the firm’s established portfolio inclusion
policies. Once established, these composites (containing actual wrap fee portfolios)
must be used when presenting gips composite reports to wrap fee prospective
clients.

###### Carve-Outs

1. A.15Any carve-out included in a composite must include cash and any related income.
Cash may be:

a. Accounted for separately, or

b. Allocated synthetically to the carve-out on a timely and consistent basis.

1. A.16Any carve-out included in a composite must be representative of a standalone
portfolio managed or intended to be managed according to that strategy.

1. A.17When the firm creates a carve-out of a particular strategy, allocates cash to the
carve-out, and includes the carve-out in a composite, the firm must create
carve-outs with allocated cash from all portfolios and portfolio segments within
the firm managed to that strategy and must include those carve-outs with allocated
cash in the composite.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
1. A.18When the firm has or obtains standalone portfolios managed in the same strategy as
the carve-outs with allocated cash, the firm must create a separate composite for the
standalone portfolios.

1. A.19The firm must not combine different composites, pooled funds, or carve-outs to
create a simulated strategy and present it as a composite.

##### 3.B. Composite and Pooled Fund Maintenance—Recommendations

1. B.1If the firm sets a minimum asset level for portfolios to be included in a composite,
the firm should not present a gips composite report to a prospective client
known not to meet the composite’s minimum asset level.

1. B.2To remove the effect of a significant cash flow, the firm should use a temporary
new account.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>## 8. GIPS ADVERTISING GUIDELINES

##### Purpose of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines

The GIPS Advertising Guidelines provide firms with options for advertising when mentioning
the firm’s claim of compliance. The GIPS Advertising Guidelines do not replace the GIPS stan-
dards, nor do they absolve firms from presenting gips composite reports and gips pooled
fund reports as required by the GIPS standards. These guidelines apply only to firms that
already satisfy all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and
prepare an advertisement that adheres to the requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines
(a “gips advertisement”). Firms may also choose to include a gips composite report or gips
pooled fund report in the advertisement.

##### Definitions

###### Advertisement

For the GIPS Advertising Guidelines, an advertisement includes any materials that are distributed
to or designed for use in newspapers, magazines, firm brochures, pooled fund fact sheets,
pooled fund offering documents, letters, media, websites, or any other written or electronic
material distributed to more than one party, and there is no contact between the firm and the
reader of the advertisement. One-on-one presentations and individual client reporting are not
considered advertisements.

###### GIPS Advertisement

A gips advertisement is an advertisement by a GIPS-compliant firm that adheres to the
requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.

##### Relationship of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines
##### to Regulatory Requirements

When preparing gips advertisements, firms must also adhere to all applicable laws and reg-
ulations governing advertisements. Firms are encouraged to seek legal or regulatory counsel
because additional disclosures may be required. In cases where applicable laws or regulations
conflict with the requirements of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines,
firms are required to comply with the laws or regulations.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>##### Other Information

The gips advertisement may include other information beyond what is required or
recommended under the GIPS Advertising Guidelines provided the information is shown
with equal or lesser prominence relative to the information required or recommended by the
GIPS Advertising Guidelines and the information does not conflict with the requirements or
recommendations of the GIPS standards or the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. Firms must
adhere to the principles of fair representation and full disclosure when advertising and must not
present performance or performance-related information that is false or misleading.

##### 8.A. Fundamental Requirements of the GIPS Advertising
##### Guidelines

1. A.1The GIPS Advertising Guidelines apply only to firms that already claim compliance with
the GIPS standards.

1. A.2A firm that chooses to claim compliance in a gips advertisement must comply with all
applicable requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.

1. A.3The firm must maintain all data and information necessary to support all items included
in a gips advertisement.

1. A.4Returns for periods of less than one year included in a gips advertisement must not
be annualized.

(i.e., cash basis).

**additional risk measures** Risk measures included in a gips composite report or gips pooled
fund report beyond those required to be presented.

**administrative fee** All fees other than transaction costs and the investment
management fee. Administrative fees may include custody
fees, accounting fees, auditing fees, consulting fees, legal fees,
performance measurement fees, and other related fees.

**advisory-only assets** Assets for which the firm provides investment recommendations but
has no control over implementation of investment decisions and no
trading authority.

**all-in fee** A type of bundled fee that can include any combination of
investment management fees, transaction costs, custody
fees, and administrative fees. All-in fees are typically offered in
certain jurisdictions where asset management, brokerage, and custody
services are offered by the same company.

**benchmark** A point of reference against which the composite’s or pooled
fund’s returns or risk are compared.

**benchmark description** General information regarding the investments, structure, and charac-
teristics of the benchmark. The description must include the key fea-
tures of the benchmark or the name of the benchmark for a readily
recognized index or other point of reference.

A pooled fund that is regulated under a framework that would
permit the general public to purchase or hold the pooled fund’s
shares and is not exclusively offered in one-on-one presentations.

**bundled fee** A fee that combines multiple fees into one total or “bundled” fee.

period. Beginning capital is adjusted by weighting the external cash
flows that occurred during the period.

**capital return** The change in value of the real estate investments and cash and/
or cash equivalent assets held throughout the measurement period,
adjusted for all capital expenditures (subtracted) and net proceeds
from sales (added). The capital return is computed as a percentage

**primary fund** An investment vehicle that makes direct investments rather than
investing in other investment vehicles.

**private equity** Investment strategies include, but are not limited to, venture capital,
leveraged buyouts, consolidations, mezzanine and distressed debt
investments, and a variety of hybrids, such as venture leasing and
venture factoring.

**private market investments** Includes real assets (e.g., real estate and infrastructure), private
equity, and similar investments that are illiquid, not publicly traded,
and not traded on an exchange.

**proprietary assets** Investments owned by the firm, the firm’s management, and/or
the firm’s parent company that are managed by the firm. General
partner assets in a pooled fund are considered proprietary assets.

**prospective client** Any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s
composite strategies and qualifies to invest in the composite.
Current clients may also qualify as prospective clients for any
composite strategy that differs from their current investment strat-
egy. Investment consultants and other third parties are included as
prospective clients if they represent individuals or entities that
qualify as prospective clients.

**prospective investor** Any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firm’s
pooled funds and qualifies to invest in the pooled fund. Current
pooled fund investors may also qualify as prospective investors
for any pooled fund that differs from their current pooled fund.
Investment consultants and other third parties are included as
prospective investors if they represent individuals or entities that
qualify as prospective investors.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>**public market equivalent**
**(pme)**
The performance of a public market index expressed in terms of a
money-weighted return (MWR), using the same cash flows and
timing as those of the composite or pooled fund over the same
period. A PME can be used as a benchmark by comparing the
MWR of a composite or pooled fund with the PME of a public
market index.

**pure gross-of-fees** The return on investments that is not reduced by any transaction
costs incurred during the period.

**real estate** Real estate includes wholly owned or partially owned:

- • Investments in land, including products grown from the land(e.g., timber or crops).

- • Buildings under development, completed buildings, and otherstructures or improvements.

- • Equity-oriented debt (e.g., participating mortgage loans).

- • Private interest in a property for which some portion of the returnto the investor at the time of investment relates to the performance
of the underlying real estate.

**realization multiple (dpi)** Since-inception distributions divided by since-inception
paid-in capital.

**recommend/**
**recommendation**
A suggested provision, task, or action that should be followed or
performed. A recommendation is considered to be best practice
but is not a requirement. (See “should.”)

**require/requirement** A provision, task, or action that must be followed or performed.

**residual value** The remaining equity that limited partners or investors have in an
investment vehicle at the end of the performance reporting period.

**rvpi (unrealized multiple)** Residual value divided by since-inception paid-in capital.

**sales charges and loads** The costs associated with buying or selling shares of a pooled fund.
These costs may also be known as subscription and redemption costs
or as entry and exit fees.

**segregated account** A portfolio owned by a single client.

**should** A provision, task, or action that is recommended to be followed or
performed and is considered to be best practice but is not required.

**should not** A task or action that is recommended not to be followed or
performed and is considered best practice not to do so.
*(continued)*

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>**side pocket** A type of account used mainly in alternative investment pooled
funds to separate illiquid investments or distressed assets from
other, more liquid investments or to segregate investments held for a
special purpose from other investments. Side pockets are typically
not available for investing for new pooled fund investors that invest
after the side pocket was created.

**significant cash flow** The level at which the firm determines that one or more client-directed
external cash flows may temporarily prevent the firm from imple-
menting the composite strategy. The cash flow may be defined by
the firm as a single flow or an aggregate of a number of flows within
a stated period. The measure of significance must be determined as
either a specific monetary amount (e.g., €50,000,000) or a percentage of
portfolio assets (based on the most recent valuation), and no other
criteria, such as the effect of the cash flow or the number of portfo-
lios in the composite, may be considered. Transfers of assets between
asset classes within a portfolio or firm-initiated cash flows must
not be considered significant cash flows.

**since-inception** For composites, from the composite inception date.

For pooled funds, from the pooled fund inception date.

**standard deviation** A measure of the variability of returns. As a measure of internal
dispersion, standard deviation quantifies the distribution of the
individual portfolios’ returns within the composite. As a measure
of historical risk, standard deviation quantifies the variability of
the composite, pooled fund, or benchmark returns over time.
Also referred to as “external standard deviation.”

**sub-advisor** A third-party investment manager hired by the firm to manage some
or all of the assets for which a firm has investment management
responsibility. May also be referred to as a sub-manager or third-party
investment manager.

**subscription line of credit** A loan facility that is put in place to facilitate administration when the
firm is calling for funds from investors. Alternatively, it can be used in
lieu of calling funds from investors.

**supplemental information** Any performance-related information included as part of a gips
composite report or gips pooled fund report that supplements
or enhances the requirements and/or recommendations of the
GIPS standards.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>**temporary new account** An account for temporarily holding client-directed external cash
flows until they are invested according to the composite strategy or
disbursed. A firm can use a temporary new account to remove
the effect of a significant cash flow on a portfolio. When a
significant cash flow occurs in a portfolio, the firm may direct
the external cash flow to a temporary new account according
to the composite’s significant cash flow policy.

**theoretical performance** Performance that is not derived from a portfolio or composite
with actual assets invested in the strategy presented. Theoretical
performance includes model, backtested, hypothetical, simulated,
indicative, ex ante, and forward-looking performance.

**time-weighted return (twr)** A method of calculating period-by-period returns that reflects the
change in value and negates the effects of external cash flows.

**total firm assets** All discretionary and non-discretionary assets for which a firm has
investment management responsibility. Total firm assets include
assets assigned to a sub-advisor provided the firm has discretion
over the selection of the sub-advisor.

**total pooled fund fees** All fees and expenses charged to the pooled fund, including but not
limited to investment management fees and administrative
fees.

**total return** The rate of return that includes the realized and unrealized gains and
losses plus income for the measurement period.

**total value** Residual value plus distributions.

**trade date accounting** Recognizing the asset or liability on the date of the purchase or sale
and not on the settlement date. Recognizing the asset or liability
within three business days of the date upon which the transaction is
entered (trade date, T + 1, T + 2, or T + 3) satisfies the trade date
accounting requirement for purposes of the GIPS standards.

**transaction costs** The costs of buying or selling investments. These costs typically take
the form of brokerage commissions, exchange fees and/or taxes, and/
or bid–offer spreads from either internal or external brokers. Custodial
fees charged per transaction should be considered custody fees
and not transaction costs. For real estate, private equity, and
other private market investments, transaction costs include
all legal, financial, advisory, and investment banking fees related to
buying, selling, restructuring, and/or recapitalizing investments but do
not include dead deal costs.
*(continued)*

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>**tvpi (investment multiple)** Total value divided by since-inception paid-in capital.

**unrealized multiple (rvpi)** Residual value divided by since-inception paid-in capital.

**verification** A process by which an independent verifier conducts testing of a firm
on a firm-wide basis, in accordance with the required verification
procedures of the GIPS standards.

**verification report** A report issued by an independent verifier after a verification has
been performed.

**vintage year** Two methods used to determine vintage year are:

1. The year of the investment vehicle’s first drawdown or capital callfrom its investors.

1. The year when the first committed capital from outsideinvestors is closed and legally binding.

**wrap fee** A type of bundled fee specific to a particular investment product.
The wrap fee is charged by a wrap fee sponsor for investment man-
agement services and typically includes associated transaction
costs that cannot be separately identified. Wrap fees can be
all-inclusive, asset-based fees and may include a combination of
investment management fees, transaction costs, custody
fees, and/or administrative fees. A wrap fee portfolio is
sometimes referred to as a “separately managed account” (SMA) or
“managed account.”

1. Spinning Top Investments is an equity investment manager that invests solely inUS-based securities. Spinning Top Investments is defined as an independent invest-
ment management firm that is not affiliated with any parent organization. Spinning Top
Investments acquired ABC Capital in May 2014.

1. T﻿he Large Cap Growth Composite includes all institutional portfolios that invest inlarge-cap US stocks that are considered to have growth in earnings prospects that are
superior to that of the average company within the XYZ Large Cap Growth Index. Key
material risks include the risks that stock prices will decline and that the composite will
underperform its benchmark. The account minimum for the composite is $5 million.
Prior to July 2016, the account minimum was $2 million. Prior to March 2020, the name
of the composite was the Growth Composite.

1. Performance prior to May 2014 occurred while the investment management team wasaffiliated with another firm. The investment management team has managed the com-
posite since its inception, and the investment process has not changed. The historical
performance has been linked to performance earned at Spinning Top Investments.

1. The benchmark is the XYZ Large Cap Growth Index, a market-capitalization-weightedequity index of all US stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and a growth tilt.

1. Returns presented are time-weighted returns. Valuations are computed and performanceis reported in US dollars.

1. Gross-of-fees returns are presented before management and custodial fees but after all trad-ing expenses. Composite and benchmark returns are presented gross of non-reclaimable
withholding taxes. Net-of-fees returns are calculated by deducting a model management fee
of 0.083%, 1/12th of the highest management fee of 1.00%, from the monthly gross compos-
ite return. The management fee schedule for separate accounts is as follows: 1.00% on the
first $25 million; 0.60% thereafter. T﻿he management fee schedule and total expense ratio for
the Large Cap Collective Fund, which is included in the composite, are 0.65% on all assets
and 0.93%, respectively.

Composite Description
Able Management Company’s Global Absolute Return Composite is a fixed life strategy
that uses a global macro approach to find what we believe are deep value–based
equity and fixed-income securities. We look for value among beaten-down equity and
fixed-income securities, including both investment-grade and non-investment-grade |

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>bonds, and may use currency forwards to add value or for hedging purposes. Key risks:
The burden of national debt, high political risks, and a possible change in monetary pol-
icy by central banks may derail the economy. Because investments include both invest-
ment- and non-investment-grade debt, there is also the risk that credit events may affect
the valuation and repayment of principal and interest. Fixed-income securities are also
subject to interest rate risk, sector and/or country risk, and industry risk. Equity secu-
rities are subject to several risks including market risk, company-specific event risk, or
becoming worthless in the case of bankruptcy. The strategy invests in currency forwards
not only for hedging purposes but also for alpha generation. There is risk that currency
bets may not work in our favor as a result of political events, central bank intervention,
or other factors not foreseen. The investments are expected to be liquidated in December
2022, and all proceeds will be distributed at that time. The composite was created in
January 2013.

3 **.** **Custom Benchmark**

The benchmark is calculated using a modified public market equivalent (PME) of the
XYZ Global Macro Index, where capital calls are treated as cash flows to buy the index.
Rather than treat distributions as cash flows to sell the index, we compute the weight of
the distribution and remove the same weight. This modification tackles the negative net
asset value (NAV) limitation that can occur with the traditional Long–Nickels PME cal-
culation. The XYZ Global Macro Index consists of the median returns of global macro
hedge funds that typically invest in long and short positions in international stocks and
bonds, commodities, and currencies.

4 **.** **Fees**

Gross returns are gross of management fees, custodial fees, and withholding taxes but
net of all transaction costs. Net returns are net of actual management fees and transac-
tion costs but gross of custodial fees and withholding taxes.

5 **.** **Sub-Advisor**

A sub-advisor was used since the composite’s inception to manage all equity investments.

6 **.** **Fee Schedule**

The standard fixed annual management fee is 0.55% up to €50 million and 0.35%
thereafter.

7 **.** **External Cash Flows**

Effective 1 January 2020, money-weighted return (MWR) calculations use daily cash
flows. Prior to this date, external cash flows were recorded quarterly.

8 **.** **Policies**

Able Management Company’s policies for valuing investments, calculating performance,
and preparing GIPS reports are available upon request.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>9 **.** **List of Composites and Pooled Funds**

A list including composite descriptions, pooled fund descriptions for limited distribution
pooled funds, and broad distribution funds is available upon request.

1 **0.** **Change in Composite Returns**

Given the fixed life nature of the strategy and the fact that we control the timing of cash
flows to and from portfolios, we changed the type of composite returns that are pre-
sented. Effective 1 January 2020, we changed from presenting time-weighted returns
(TWRs) to MWR because the firm believes it is the most appropriate composite return.

1 **1.** **Error Correction**

An incorrect amount was previously used for a cash distribution that occurred in 2020.
The since-inception annualized gross and net composite returns have been restated from

1. 4% and 7.9% to 7.4% and 6.9%, respectively.

1. ABC Investments is an independent investment adviser registered under the InvestmentAdvisers Act of 1940 and was founded in March 1996. The firm was redefined in January
2016 to include institutional and wrap accounts. Prior to January 2016, the firm included
only institutional accounts.

1. ABC Investments claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS stan-
dards. ABC Investments has been independently verified for the period from April 1,
1996 through December 31, 2020. A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS stan-
dards must establish policies and procedures for complying with all the applicable
requirements of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the
firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well
as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed in
compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis.
The Small Cap Value Wrap Composite has had a performance examination for the period
from 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2020. The verification and performance
examination reports are available upon request.

1. The Small Cap Value Wrap Composite is composed of portfolios invested in US equitiesthat have a market capitalization of between $500 million and $2 billion at purchase.
Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile than large-cap stocks. Effective
January 1, 2016, the composite was redefined to include only wrap fee accounts. Prior to
the redefinition, the composite included only institutional accounts. Performance results

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>prior to 2016 are those of the Small Cap Value Institutional Composite. Wrap accounts
are charged a wrap fee that is based not on transactions in a client’s account but is based
on a percentage of account assets. The composite inception date is February 1, 2006. The
composite was created in March 2016.

1. All returns are calculated and presented in US dollars. Policies for valuing investments,calculating performance, and preparing GIPS reports are available upon request. A list of
composite descriptions is available upon request.

1. The benchmark is the XYZ Small Cap Value Index and is provided to represent theinvestment environment existing during the periods shown. The XYZ Small Cap Value
Index is a float-adjusted, market-cap-weighted index that measures the performance of
the smallest 800 companies traded on US exchanges with low price-to-book ratios that
are included in the XYZ 3000 Value Index. The XYZ 3000 Value Index is a float-adjusted,
market-cap-weighted index that includes 3,000 of the largest companies traded on US
exchanges with low price-to-book ratios. The index is fully invested and includes the
reinvestment of income. The returns for the index do not include any trading costs, man-
agement fees, or other costs. Index returns have been taken from published sources.

1. Pure gross returns, presented as supplemental information from 2016 through 2020,do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs, fees, or expenses. Pure gross returns
prior to 2016 reflect the deduction of transaction costs because performance is from
the Small Cap Value Institutional Composite. Effective January 1, 2016, the gross return
is calculated by applying a model transaction cost of $0.05 per share to each trade. The
firm determined the estimated transaction cost for this composite by calculating the
actual average transaction costs for accounts in the firm’s Small Cap Value Institutional
Composite. Prior to January 2016, gross returns are net of actual trading costs.

1. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable wrap fee (3.00% on an annualbasis, or 0.25% monthly) on a monthly basis from the pure gross composite monthly return.
The standard wrap fee schedule in effect is 3.00% of total assets. Wrap fees include all charges,
transaction costs, portfolio management fees, custody fees, and other administrative fees.

1. The internal dispersion is measured by the equal-weighted standard deviation of annualpure gross returns of those portfolios included in the composite for the full year. The
three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and
the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period.

1. Strategy advisory-only assets are assets for which ABC Investments provides investmentrecommendations to another firm for portfolios managed to the composite strategy but
has no control over the implementation of investment decisions or trading authority for
the assets. Firm advisory-only assets are assets for all strategies within the firm for which
ABC Investments provides investment recommendations but has no control over the
implementation of investment decisions or trading authority for the assets. Strategy and
firm advisory-only assets are presented as supplemental information.

1 **.** **Compliance Statement**

Tumble Management Limited claims compliance with the Global Investment
Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compli-
ance with the GIPS standards. Tumble Management Limited has been independently
verified for the periods 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The verification report is
available upon request. A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards must
establish policies and procedures for complying with all the applicable requirements of
the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and
procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation,
presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with
the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verification does
not provide assurance on the accuracy of any specific performance report.

2 **.** **Definition of the Firm**

Tumble Management Limited is an independent investment management firm that man-
ages currency overlay portfolios for institutional clients and is a regulated company.

3 **.** **Methodology Used to Calculate Overlay Exposure**

Tumble Management Limited does not manage any of the underlying assets for its over-
lay portfolio clients. Firm overlay exposure represents the total value of all underlying
assets for which Tumble Management Limited has a mandate to manage the currency
overlay. Composite overlay exposure represents the total value of all underlying portfo-
lios being overlaid in this composite.

4 **.** **Performance Calculation for Portfolios**

Portfolio performance is calculated on a contribution from hedges basis, whereby the
change in the portfolio’s cumulative marked-to-market value is divided by the underlying
portfolio value being overlaid at the beginning of the period.

5 **.** **Treatment of Collateral**

Management of the collateral is not part of the overlay strategy. Therefore, the value of the
collateral and any collateral income are not included in the overlay performance calculation.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>6 **.** **Leverage**

This strategy uses forward currency contracts extensively to sell one currency to invest
in another currency, in order to adjust the underlying portfolio’s currency exposure.
In volatile periods, liquidity and correlations between currencies may influence returns
significantly.

7 **.** **Custom Benchmark**

The benchmark is 100% hedged. The benchmark is based on a zero-cost one-month roll-
ing hedge, whereby mid spot rates and one-month bid–offer forward points are applied.
The composite custom benchmark is calculated using the benchmarks of the portfolios
in the composite and is rebalanced monthly based on the beginning values of the portfo-
lios. As of 31 December 2020, the custom benchmark was composed of 68% XYZ World
Index and 32% XYZ World ex-Switzerland Index. The components of the custom bench-
mark and their underlying weightings for all monthly time periods are available upon
request.

8 **.** **Fees**

Performance results are presented gross of investment management fees and net of
transaction costs. The performance will be reduced by the fees associated with portfolio
management. The standard investment management fee schedule is 0.10% of notional
value up to CHF 300 million and 0.05% thereafter.

9 **.** **Ex Post Standard Deviation**

The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the compos-
ite gross returns and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period. The
three-year annualized ex post standard deviation for the composite and benchmark is
not presented for 2011 through 2013 because the composite had fewer than 36 monthly
returns.

1 **0.** **Internal Composite Dispersion**

The composite dispersion is measured by the equal-weighted standard deviation of the
returns for each portfolio in the composite. The measure of dispersion considers only
portfolios included in the composite for the full year. When the composite consists of
five or fewer portfolios for the full year, no dispersion measure is presented.

A list of composite descriptions is available upon request. Policies for valuing portfolios,
calculating performance, and preparing GIPS reports are also available upon request.

1. Crater Capital claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS stan-
dards. Crater Capital has been independently verified for the periods 1 January 2008 to
31 December 2019. The verification report is available upon request.

A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards must establish policies and
procedures for complying with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards.
Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to
composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and
distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards
and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verification does not provide assur-
ance on the accuracy of any specific performance report.

1. For the purpose of complying with the GIPS standards, the firm is defined as Crater Capital,an independent investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

1. The High Yield Bond Carve-Out Composite includes all segregated accounts andhigh yield bond carve-outs invested in this strategy. The investment objective of the
High Yield Bond strategy is to provide investors with a high level of current income.
Accounts managed to the strategy will be primarily invested in US high-yield/high-risk
fixed-income securities rated BB or lower by a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSRO). Up to 5% of account assets may be invested in investment-grade
bonds. High-yield bonds carry increased levels of credit and default risk and are less
liquid than government and investment-grade corporate bonds. Some accounts in the
composite are carve-outs that have allocated cash. Cash and cash returns are allocated
to each account monthly, based on the high-yield segment’s beginning value relative to
the total portfolio’s beginning value, excluding cash. The GIPS Composite Report for the
High Yield Bond Composite, which includes only standalone segregated accounts man-
aged to the strategy, is available upon request.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>
1. The composite benchmark is the XYZ US High Yield Corporate Bond Index. The XYZUS High Yield Corporate Bond Index is designed to track the performance of US dollar–
denominated, high-yield corporate bonds issued by companies whose country of risk
use official G-10 currencies and excludes those countries that are members of the
United Nations Eastern European Group. Qualifying securities must have a below-
investment-grade rating and maturities of one or more months at purchase. The index
is fully invested, which includes the reinvestment of dividends/interest and capital gains.
The returns for the index do not include any transaction costs, management fees, or
other costs.

1. Composite returns are presented both gross and net of management fees. All compositereturns are net of transaction costs and gross of withholding taxes, if any, and reflect the
reinvestment of income and other earnings. The composite net-of-fees returns are cal-
culated by deducting 1/12th of the top tier of the management fee schedule (0.50%) from
the monthly gross composite return. Actual fees may vary depending on the applicable
fee schedule and the size of the account. All returns are calculated and presented in US
dollars.

1. The current standard management fee schedule for a segregated account managed to thecomposite strategy is as follows:

**ΕΕ** 0 .50% on the first $50 million.

**ΕΕ** 0 .40% on the next $200 million.

**ΕΕ** 0 .30% on all assets above $250 million.

1. The internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation ofaccount gross returns included in the composite for the full year. For those periods with
five or fewer accounts included for the entire year, “n/a” is noted because the dispersion
is not considered meaningful.

1. The three-year annualized ex post standard deviation measures the variability of thecomposite and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period.

1. Policies for valuing investments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS reportsare available upon request. Also available are the List of Composite Descriptions, the

Pudoru Investments has been independently verified for the periods from 1 April to 31 March 2021. A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards must establish
policies and procedures for complying with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS
standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures
related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation,
and distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards
and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. The Japan Large Cap Equity Fund has had
a performance examination for the periods from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021. The verifica-
tion and performance examination reports are available upon request. |

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Pudoru Investments is an equity investment manager that invests solely in Japan-based
securities.

The Japan Large Cap Equity Fund (the “Fund”) seeks to achieve long-term capital appre-
ciation by investing primarily in large-cap equity securities of Japanese issuers. Under
normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including the
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in common and preferred stocks of
large-capitalization companies. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more
sectors in selecting its investments, including the financial services sector. The value of
the Fund’s assets may be adversely affected by economic and social demographics. Japan’s
population is aging, and the government may have to increase taxes as it spends more on
healthcare, which could slow economic growth at a time when Japan has been in a prolonged
economic downturn. The Fund may borrow up to 30% of its net asset value. Historically, the
Fund’s borrowing level has averaged less than 1% of net assets and has never exceeded 10%.
Leverage may also magnify losses as well as gains to the extent that leverage is used.

The benchmark is the XYZ Japan Large Cap Index, which is designed to measure the per-
formance of the large-cap segment of the Japanese market. The index is fully invested and
includes the reinvestment of dividends.

Valuations are computed and performance is reported in Japanese yen. Policies for valu-
ing investments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS reports are available upon
request.

Gross returns are presented before the deduction of management fees but reflect the deduc-
tion of all trading and administrative expenses. Share Class A is used to calculate Fund gross
returns. Net returns are calculated by deducting 1/12th of the management fee (0.75% annu-
ally, for all share classes) from the monthly gross Fund return. The total expense ratios for
Class A and Class I as of the Fund’s most recent fiscal year end (31 March 2021) were 1.50%
and 1.35%, respectively.

A list of composite and pooled fund descriptions is available upon request.

The inception date of the Fund is 1 April 2011, which is the first day assets were invested in
the strategy.

The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the Fund and the
benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period.

In January 2019, Koh Yuwabara, the Fund’s portfolio manager, retired. Yuna Tanaka became
the portfolio manager.

2 **.** **Definition of the Firm**

CMCA is an independent investment management firm established in 2011. CMCA
invests in and manages commercial properties for our clients with a focus on the United
States and Canada.

3 **.** **Fund Description**

The Core Commercial Real Estate Fund, an open-end fund, invests in Class A commer-
cial properties across the US, including office buildings, retail space, industrial proper-
ties, and luxury multi-family dwellings. Key risks of investing in commercial real estate
include the following: interest rate risk—an increasing interest rate environment may
negatively affect valuations and drive up borrowing costs; liquidity risk—commercial
real estate properties are less liquid than many other asset classes, including stocks
and bonds. Therefore, it may take longer to sell a property, and property values could
move down before we have the chance to realize any unrealized gains; economic risk—
commercial property tends to do better when the economy is expanding. During eco-
nomic downturns, commercial real estate prices may take longer to recover than other
asset classes. A moderate level of leverage, typically ranging between 15 and 30%, is used.
Leverage magnifies gains and losses. Performance is compared to the XYZ National Core
Commercial Property Index.

4 **.** **Inception Date**

The performance inception date of the fund is 1 March 2012, which is the first day an
investment took place.

5 **.** **Benchmark**

The XYZ National Core Commercial Property Index is an index of geographically diverse
commercial properties across the United States. Benchmark returns are a monthly time
series of unlevered US commercial properties weighted 25% office, 25% retail, 25% indus-
trial, and 25% multi-family housing. Benchmark returns are calculated quarterly.

6 **.** **Returns and Fees**

Capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and lease commissions are capitalized,
included in the cost of property, and reflected in the capital returns. Gross returns are
net of actual transaction costs, custodial, and administrative fees. Net returns are net
of actual transaction costs, custodial and administrative fees, and management fees.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Net returns are from the institutional (I share) class. All returns and asset values are
expressed in US dollars. The management fee schedule for the I share class is 0.80% per
annum. The total expense ratio of the I share class was 1.65% as of 31 December 2020.

7 **.** **Ex Post Standard Deviation**

The three-year annualized ex post standard deviation for the fund and benchmark are
not presented because fund returns are calculated quarterly and monthly returns are not
available.

8 **.** **Valuations**

Investments are valued and returns are calculated quarterly. Internal valuations are deter-
mined by applying market discount rates to future projections of gross cash flows and
capitalized terminal values over the expected holding period for each asset. To the extent
debt is used, the debt is valued separately from the real estate. Properties are externally
valued annually. All investments are valued using subjective, unobservable inputs.

9 **.** **Availability**

A list of composite and limited distribution pooled fund descriptions, as well as a list
of broad distribution pooled funds, are available on request. Policies for valuing invest-
ments, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS Reports are available upon request.

(GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards.
Armor Management has been independently verified for the periods 1 October 2007 through
31 December 2020. The verification report is available upon request. A firm that claims
compliance with the GIPS standards must establish policies and procedures for complying
with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance
on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund main-
tenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been
designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide
basis. Verification does not provide assurance on the accuracy of any specific performance
report.

1 **.** **Definition of the Firm**

Armor Management is an independent investment management firm established in
2 007. Armor Management manages a variety of equity, fixed-income, and balanced
assets, primarily for European clients.

2 **.** **Currency**

Performance is calculated and reported in euros (€).

3 **.** **Pooled Fund Description**

The Armor Distressed Debt Fund’s returns reflect the EUR share class. The fund invests
at least 85% of its assets in distressed euro-denominated bonds that have credit ratings of
CCC or lower by at least one major credit rating agency. Key risks include widening cor-
porate spreads and defaults, high levels of government debt, and elevated political ten-
sions, which could lead to abrupt changes in monetary policy by the European Central
Bank (ECB). A material amount of the fund’s investments may be illiquid.

4 **.** **Valuation**

As of 31 December 2020, 25% of the fund’s investments were internally valued. There is
no market activity to support valuation for these investments; therefore, valuations are
based on the firm’s proprietary pricing model using the Euro XYZ Index Swaps yield
curve and credit spreads.

5 **.** **Custom Benchmark**

The custom benchmark return is calculated by applying the investment cash flows of
the Armor Distressed Debt Fund to the XYZ Eurozone Distressed Debt Bond Index.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>The index reflects a portfolio of euro-denominated distressed debt bonds issued in
Eurozone countries that generally have credit ratings of CCC or lower from the main
rating agencies and are listed on the XYZ platforms.

6 **.** **Returns and Fees**

Fund returns are net of actual total fund fees and are calculated using the assets of the
limited partners. Total fund fees include transaction costs, custodian and other admin-
istrative fees, and management fees. The return with the subscription line of credit
(LOC) begins at the time of the first capital call from the limited partners which reduces
the performance period. This generally will magnify gains or losses in money-weighted
returns. The return without the subscription LOC begins with the date of the first fund
investment. All returns reflect the deduction of fees and expenses for the subscription
LOC.

7 **.** **List of Composite and Pooled Fund Descriptions**

A list of composite and limited distribution pooled fund descriptions is available upon
request.

8 **.** **Policies**

Armor Management’s policies for valuing investments, calculating performance, and
preparing GIPS reports are available upon request.

1. **Fee Schedule**
The fixed management fee for the fund is 0.55% per annum. The total expense ratio as of
the most recent year end was 0.86%.

1 **0.** **Subscription Line of Credit**

The fund has a subscription line of credit of €50 million, of which €20 million is out-
standing as of 31 December 2020. The subscription line of credit allows the fund to pur-
chase securities without the need to immediately call capital. Interest paid on the line of
credit is LIBOR plus 1.5%. The subscription line of credit does not affect the amount of
capital called or the committed capital amount.

The benchmark is the XYZ Global Bond Index. This index covers the global investment-grade
fixed-rate bond market, including government, credit, and collateralized securities. Indexes
are unmanaged and do not incur fees. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

The total Fund expense ratio is calculated based on the Fund’s average net assets during the
Fund’s most recently completed fiscal year and has not been adjusted for current asset levels.
The expense ratio includes operating costs, including administrative, compliance, distribu-
tion, management, marketing, shareholder services, and record-keeping fees. Please see the
Fund’s prospectus for additional details.

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted performance that measures a portfolio’s risk–
return efficiency. The risk-free rate used to calculate the Fund’s Sharpe ratio is the 90-day

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Treasury bill. The annualized ex post standard deviation measures the variability of the Class
A net returns and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period.

###### Primary Risks of the Fund

***An investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no***
***assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and you may lose money.***

*Active Management Risk:* As a result of the investment management team’s investment deci-
sions, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar
investment objective or strategies.

*Credit Risk:* An issuer of debt securities may fail to make interest payments or repay principal
when due, in whole or in part.

*Currency Risk:* Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short or extended periods of
time (i.e., may be extremely volatile), which could result in losses to the Fund if currencies do
not perform as the investment manager expects. Changes in currency exchange rates affect
the value of the investments that the Fund owns and the Fund’s share price.

*Derivatives Risk:* The performance of derivative instruments depends largely on the perfor-
mance of an underlying currency, security, interest rate or index, and such instruments often
have risks similar to the underlying instrument, in addition to other risks. Derivatives involve
costs and can create economic leverage in the Fund’s portfolio, which may result in signifi-
cant volatility and cause the Fund to participate in losses (as well as gains) in an amount that
significantly exceeds the Fund’s initial investment.

*Emerging Market Countries Risk:* The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries are
subject to all of the risks of foreign investing generally and have additional heightened risks
because of a lack of established legal, political, business, and social frameworks to support
securities and currency markets.

*Foreign Securities Risk:* Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than
investing in US securities, including risks associated with (i) internal and external political
and economic developments, (ii) trading practices, (iii) availability of information, (iv) lim-
ited markets, and (v) currency exchange rate fluctuations and policies.

*High-Yield Debt Securities Risk:* Issuers of lower-rated or “high-yield” debt securities (also
known as “junk bonds”) are not as strong financially as those issuing higher-credit-quality
debt securities. High-yield debt securities are more likely to encounter financial difficulties
and are more vulnerable to changes in the relevant economy, such as a recession or a sus-
tained period of rising interest rates, that could affect their ability to make interest and prin-
cipal payments when due. The prices of high-yield debt securities generally fluctuate more

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>than those of higher credit quality. High-yield debt securities are generally more illiquid
(harder to sell).

*Prepayment Risk:* The risk that borrowers will repay a loan more quickly in periods of falling
interest rates.

*Sovereign Debt Risk:* The Fund may invest in US and non-US government debt securities
(“sovereign debt”). Some investments in sovereign debt, such as US sovereign debt, are con-
sidered low risk. Investments in sovereign debt, especially the debt of less developed coun-
tries, can involve a high degree of risk, however, including the risk that the governmental
entity that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may not be willing or able to repay the
principal and/or to pay the interest on its sovereign debt in a timely manner. In the event
of default, there may be limited or no legal remedies for collecting sovereign debt and there
may be no bankruptcy proceedings through which the Fund may collect all or part of the
sovereign debt that a governmental entity has not repaid.

Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of, and not neces-
sarily indicative of, future results.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>## APPENDIX D: SAMPLE LISTS

##### List of Composite Descriptions

1 **.** **US Large Cap Equity Growth Composite**

The US Large Cap Equity Growth Composite includes all segregated accounts and pooled
funds that invest in large-capitalization US stocks considered to have earnings growth pros-
pects that are superior to that of the average company within the benchmark, the XYZ Large
Cap Growth Index. The targeted tracking error is less than 4% per annum.

2 **.** **US Balanced Growth Composite**

The US Balanced Growth Composite includes all balanced segregated accounts and pooled
funds that invest in large-cap US equities and investment-grade bonds, including government,
corporate, mortgage-backed, and asset-backed securities. The strategy’s investment goal is to
provide long-term capital growth and steady income through the creation of a well-diversified
portfolio. Although the strategy allows for equity exposure ranging between 50% and 70%, the
typical allocation is between 55% and 65%.

3 **.** **Unconstrained Activist UK Equity Composite**

The Unconstrained Activist UK Equity Composite includes all segregated accounts and pooled
funds invested in both listed and unlisted UK equities that pursue an activist investment pol-
icy. There is no restriction on the market capitalization of companies held. Portfolios within
this composite are highly concentrated, holding approximately 15 securities. Returns may
have a lower correlation with the benchmark return than a fully diversified strategy. In times
of increased market volatility, the composite characteristics may change significantly, and
stock liquidity could be reduced. Because of the strategy’s concentrated nature, portfolios tend
to have more stock-specific risk than a more diversified strategy. The strategy cannot employ
leverage, but portfolios may use both exchange-traded and OTC derivative contracts for effi-
cient portfolio management, which may expose the strategy to counterparty default risk.

4 **.** **Unconstrained Activist UK Equity Carve-Out Composite**

The Unconstrained Activist UK Equity Carve-Out Composite includes all accounts, including
carve-out accounts with allocated cash, and pooled funds invested in both listed and unlisted
UK equities that pursue an activist investment policy. There is no restriction on the market
capitalization of companies held. Portfolios within this composite are highly concentrated,
holding approximately 15 securities. Returns may have a lower correlation with the bench-
mark return than a fully diversified strategy. In times of increased market volatility, the com-
posite characteristics may change significantly and stock liquidity could be reduced. Because
of the strategy’s concentrated nature, portfolios tend to have more stock-specific risk than a
more diversified strategy. The strategy cannot employ leverage, but portfolios may use both

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>exchange-traded and OTC derivative contracts for efficient portfolio management, which may
expose the strategy to counterparty default risk.

5 **.** **UK Liquidity Plus Composite**

The UK Liquidity Plus Composite includes all segregated accounts and pooled funds invested
in a broad range of short-dated interest-bearing deposits, cash equivalents, short-term com-
mercial paper, and other money market investments issued by major UK clearing banks and
lending institutions. The strategy has a targeted modified duration of less than one year. The
principal investment objectives are preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity, and pro-
vision of yield greater than that available for the benchmark, the three-month risk-free rate.
The UK Liquidity Plus strategy differs from more-conventional cash strategies in that it addi-
tionally holds short-term commercial paper, which has a greater exposure to credit risk.

6 **.** **Emerging Market High Yield Fixed Income Composite**

The Emerging Market High Yield Fixed Income Composite includes all pooled funds invested
in high-yield debt securities issued by companies outside the OECD. The strategy allows for
investment in foreign currency–denominated assets over which the manager has full dis-
cretion on hedging. Currency hedging may include instruments such as forward contracts,
futures, or foreign exchange derivatives, which may expose the strategy to counterparty
default risk. The strategy aims to deliver a total return primarily through income but with
some capital growth. High-yield bonds carry increased levels of credit and default risk and
are less liquid than government and investment-grade corporate bonds. Investment in less
regulated markets carries increased political, economic, and issuer risk. Inherent in fixed-
income investing is interest rate and duration risk. Increases to interest rates may nega-
tively affect portfolio valuations. Those risks are magnified when portfolios are invested in
bonds with long-dated maturities. The benchmark is the XYZ Emerging Market Bond Index,
USD Hedged.

7 **.** **Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) Global Equity Composite**

The Socially Responsible Investments Global Equity Composite includes all segregated
accounts and pooled funds that invest in global equity securities issued by companies that
make a positive contribution to society and the environment through sustainable and socially
responsible practices. Only securities of companies that meet our proprietary SRI score
threshold are allowed. The strategy aims to provide long-term capital appreciation together
with a growing income stream through investment in a portfolio of core equity holdings diver-
sified by economic sector, industry group, and geographic business concentration. All foreign
currency exposures are fully hedged to US dollars using forward contracts, futures, or foreign
exchange derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and derivatives traded over the counter have
counterparty default risk. The SRI process tends to screen out certain companies and sectors,
which may result in a more concentrated strategy than a fully diversified strategy. The bench-
mark is the XYZ World SRI Index.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>8 **.** **Leveraged Bond Composite**

The Leveraged Bond Composite includes all segregated accounts in a diversified range of high-
yield corporate and government bonds, with the aim of providing investors with a high level
of income while seeking to maximize the total return. The accounts are invested in domestic
and international fixed-income securities of varying maturities. Inherent in fixed-income
investing are interest rate risk and duration risk. Increases to interest rates may negatively
affect portfolio valuations. These risks are magnified when portfolios are invested in bonds
with long-dated maturities. The strategy also allows investment in exchange-traded and OTC
derivative contracts (including, but not limited to, options, futures, swaps, and forward cur-
rency contracts) for the purposes of risk, volatility, and currency exposure management. The
strategy allows leverage up to but not exceeding twice the value of a portfolio’s investments
through the use of repurchase financing arrangements with counterparties. Inherent in deriv-
ative instrument investments is the risk of counterparty default. Leverage may also magnify
losses as well as gains to the extent that leverage is used. The benchmark is the XYZ Global
Aggregate Bond Index. The strategy is managed with a maximum tracking error of 6% to 8%
per annum.

9 **.** **Global Commodity Equity Composite**

The Global Commodity Equity Composite includes segregated accounts that globally invest in
a diversified range of companies that provide exposure to commodities, energy, and materials.
Investment is primarily through the common stock of these companies. Investment directly
in raw materials is allowable to a maximum exposure of 10%. Exchange-traded funds and
exchange-traded commodity securities up to a maximum 20% exposure are also allowed. The
base currency is US dollars, and any or all of the currency risk associated with investments
in currencies other than US dollars may be hedged between 0% and 100% using forward con-
tracts, futures, or foreign exchange derivatives. The strategy cannot employ leverage but may
use exchange-traded derivative instruments for efficient portfolio management.

Investments directly or indirectly in commodities may add to portfolio volatility. Global com-
modity prices can be affected by changes in legislation, national and supra-national policies,
and consumer behaviors. In times of commodity price volatility, the liquidity of directly held
commodities and the correlation with the broad market can change quickly. Foreign exchange
forwards and derivatives traded over the counter have counterparty default risk. In those
instances in which currency risk is not hedged, the strategy may be exposed to exchange-rate
risk that may create fluctuating gains and/or losses.

1 **0.** **Currency Overlay Composite**

The Currency Overlay Composite includes all segregated accounts invested in a broad range
of foreign currency–denominated instruments, such as forward contracts, futures, or foreign
exchange derivatives. The principal investment objective is active alpha generation through
currency appreciation from movements in exchange rates where the original currency expo-
sures stem from a global or international portfolio. Currency-related investing carries inher-
ent risks related to changes in macroeconomic policy, which can be amplified in the case of

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>emerging markets, where political regime shifts and changes in the control of capital may
be more prevalent than in developed markets. In volatile periods, liquidity and correlations
between currencies may change expected returns drastically. Foreign exchange forwards and
derivatives traded over the counter have counterparty default risk.

1 **1.** **Tactical Asset Allocation Overlay Composite**

The Tactical Asset Allocation Overlay Composite includes all segregated accounts in which
the investment approach is designed to profit from the increase/decrease in exposure to one
or more asset classes. Managing the collateral is part of the strategy. The accounts in this com-
posite are hedged to euros using forward contracts, futures, or foreign exchange derivatives.
Allocation shifts are typically implemented via long and short futures, options, and swaptions.
This strategy allows leverage up to but not exceeding 180% of each account’s value. Accounts
are expected to have an investment exposure above 100%. Inherent in derivative instruments
is the risk of counterparty default. A leveraged account may result in large fluctuations in
value and entails a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses.

1 **2.** **Covered Call Writing Overlay Composite**

The Covered Call Writing Overlay Composite is composed of all segregated accounts for
which covered call writing is conducted to generate additional income for an underlying large-
cap US equity portfolio. The strategy seeks to generate monthly option premium income while
protecting against downward moves in the underlying portfolio through selling covered calls
with a monthly duration on US equities held in the underlying portfolio, either at the money
or slightly out of or in the money. The use of derivatives, such as equity options, can involve a
high degree of financial risk because a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying
security or benchmark may result in an unexpected or disproportionately large movement,
unfavorable or favorable, in the price of the derivative instrument. The strategy does not use
leverage.

1 **3.** **Asian Market Neutral Composite**

The Asian Market Neutral Composite includes all segregated accounts with a market-neutral
strategy that invests in publicly traded companies with market capitalizations greater than
$500 million in developed and emerging Asian markets. The strategy’s principal objective is to
outperform the return of the three-month US Treasury Bill by at least 1 percentage point per
annum. The strategy uses a risk-controlled quantitative screening and optimization process
that invests at least 85% of the net asset value in long equity positions and at least 85% of the
net asset value in short equity positions. The strategy’s long portion overweights those securi-
ties that have been quantitatively identified as potentially exhibiting superior and sustainable
earnings growth compared with the market. The strategy’s short portion consists of securities
that have been identified as having inferior growth prospects or that may also be adversely
affected by either specific events or momentum considerations. The strategy may engage in
currency hedging using instruments such as forward contracts, futures, or foreign exchange
derivatives.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>The Asian Market Neutral strategy seeks to balance exposures between long and short posi-
tions so that broad market movements are neutralized. In certain market conditions, the
investment process behind the strategy can give rise to unmatched country, sector, industry,
market capitalization, and/or style bias exposures in the portfolio. Investment in less regulated
markets carries increased political, economic, and issuer risk. Foreign exchange forwards and
derivatives traded over the counter have counterparty default risk. This active trading strategy
involves significantly greater stock turnover when compared to passive strategies.

1 **4.** **Value-Added Asian Real Estate Composite**

The Value-Added Asian Real Estate Composite consists of all portfolios managed within the
value-added investment strategy. The strategy has an equal focus on income and capital appre-
ciation. The strategy invests in multi-family, office, industrial, and retail property types within
developed Asian markets that require correction or mitigation of the investments’ operating,
financial, redevelopment, and/or management risk(s). A level of leverage ranging between
60% and 80% is used. Leverage may magnify losses as well as gains to the extent that it is used.
All foreign currency exposures are fully hedged to Singapore dollars using forward contracts,
futures, or foreign exchange derivatives. Foreign exchange forwards and derivatives traded
over the counter have counterparty default risk. Real estate investments are generally illiquid.

1 **5.** **Leveraged US Direct Lending Senior Composite**

The Leveraged US Direct Lending Senior Composite includes all pooled funds that primar-
ily invest in directly originated, US dollar–denominated first lien and unitranche loans to
high-quality US middle market companies. Middle market companies are generally defined
as having $10 million to $150 million of EBITDA and are primarily backed by private equity
sponsors. The strategy seeks to generate higher levels of income and total return than the
broadly syndicated leveraged loan market, with less volatility. The strategy uses leverage to
increase returns. The target level of leverage is 100% with a maximum allowable level of 150%.
Directly originated loans are generally illiquid and carry increased liquidity risk. Leverage may
magnify gains as well as losses to the extent that it is used. Funds in the composite are struc-
tured as drawdown funds, whereby the firm has control over capital calls and distributions.

###### Terminated Composites

1 **.** **US Core Equity Composite**

The US Core Equity Composite includes all segregated accounts and pooled funds managed to
a growth at a reasonable price (GARP) strategy through investment in a high-quality, focused
portfolio of domestic, large-capitalization stocks expected to generate returns above the XYZ
Large Cap Index over a market cycle. A quantitative screening process is used together with
fundamental research to construct portfolios. The strategy is managed with a maximum track-
ing error of 4% per annum. Quantitative-driven investment screening relies on historical stock
correlations, which can be adversely affected during periods of severe market volatility. The
composite terminated in March 2018.

###### Stable Growth 2022 Fund

The investment objective of the Stable Growth 2022 Fund is to realize stable capital growth con-
sistent with strict risk control, while ensuring sufficient liquidity is available for investment. This
is a medium/low-level risk product with an expected moderate level of income. Client-invested
assets will be locked up until 31 December 2022; no redemption is allowed during this period.
The Fund aims to invest in treasury bonds, municipal bonds, central bank bills, medium and small
enterprise private bonds, commercial paper, medium-term notes, and asset-backed securities, as
well as other money market funds, bond funds, or bank deposit products, all of which are issued
in China’s domestic market. This Fund may also invest in products such as bank-issued wealth
management products and specific asset management plans (SAMPs) issued by another fund
management house or securities house. The Fund may invest in other SAMPs under management
by our firm or by our parent company, ABC Fund House, with possible related-party transactions
involved. Asset allocation among the investment instruments can vary from 0% to 100% of total
fund assets. The Fund is benchmarked against the three-month Financial Institution Deposit Rate
+ Net Interest Income (NII). The NII is greater than 1% and less than 10%, as stated in the sub-
scription legal document. Interest rate risk is a primary risk of the fund. When interest rates rise,
debt security prices generally fall.

###### Contrarian Core Trust Fund

The Contrarian Core Trust Fund seeks to provide total returns that are composed of current
income and long-term capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, the investment team strives
to capitalize on out-of-favor stocks that the market has undervalued. The team uses both quanti-
tative and fundamental research to select investments from the large universe of equity securities.
Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities
of US companies that have large market capitalizations that the investment management team
believes are undervalued and have the potential for long-term growth and current income. The
Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in foreign securities. The Fund may invest directly
in foreign securities or indirectly through American depositary receipts. Investing in foreign secu-
rities typically involves more risks than investing in US securities, including risks associated with
(i) internal and external political and economic developments, (ii) trading practices, (iii) availabil-
ity of information, (iv) limited markets, and (v) currency exchange rate fluctuations and policies.
The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more sectors in selecting its investments,
including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related
sectors. The Fund’s benchmark is the XYZ Large Cap Index. The Fund’s principal risks are
active management risk, depositary receipt risk, issuer risk, market risk, sector risk, and value
securities risk.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>###### Global Liquidity Relative Value Fund

The Global Liquidity Relative Value Fund invests in long and short positions in government secu-
rities of the United States and other developed markets, US agency securities, mortgage-backed
securities issued or guaranteed by US government-sponsored enterprises or agencies, and deriv-
atives. The Fund may also invest in long and short positions in government securities of select
emerging market countries. It seeks to maximize total return on a risk-adjusted basis. Investment
risks include currency fluctuation, political and economic changes, and emergent financial mar-
kets. Fixed-income derivatives may be used, including bond futures, swaps, and options. These
investments are both exchange-traded and traded over the counter with approved counterpar-
ties, which minimizes liquidity risk. They are used for three purposes: timing to catch immediate
market moves, providing the cheapest means of gaining or reducing interest rate and currency
exposure, and creating an asymmetrical risk–return profile during times of heightened volatility.
Derivatives usage exposes the Fund to risks different from, and potentially greater than, the risks
associated with investing directly in securities and may result in additional loss, which could be
greater than the cost of the derivative. The Fund may use leverage by purchasing securities on
margin or by entering into repurchase agreements and credit agreements. The Fund may pledge
its securities to borrow additional funds or otherwise obtain leverage for investment or other pur-
poses. Leverage reflects the greater of the absolute value of the long or short positions of the Fund
divided by the Fund’s net asset value. The Fund is generally levered in the range of 10 to 12 times.
The use of leverage may result in large fluctuations in the Fund’s value and entails a high degree of
risk, including the possibility of substantial losses.

###### European Real Estate Fund

The European Real Estate Fund is a core, diversified real estate fund that invests in European com-
mercial real estate that exhibits strong and stable cash flow and the potential for long-term capital
growth. This Fund is offered only to professional investors. The European Real Estate Fund is a
low-leveraged fund that invests primarily in industrial, retail, and office properties located across
Europe. The focus is on properties that have a steady income and properties that, through devel-
opment or redevelopment, have the potential to achieve future positive returns. The target level of
leverage is 50% with a maximum allowable level of 60%. A leveraged fund may result in large fluctua-
tions in the value of the Fund and entails a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial
losses. Real estate investments are generally illiquid, and the investment outlook may change given
the availability of credit or other financing sources. Because of the illiquidity, withdrawals could take
some time to execute. The Fund is benchmarked to the XYZ Commercial Real Estate Index.

###### European Private Equity Fund

The European Private Equity Fund is a fund-of-private equity funds that invests in European small-
and mid-cap buyout, growth, and restructuring funds. This Fund requires a minimum commitment

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>of €10 million, and is offered only to professional investors who can withstand a total loss of their
initial investment. Capital calls are dependent on investment progress and subscription amount. The
Fund uses leverage. The target level of leverage is 40% with a maximum allowable level of 60%. A
leveraged fund may incur large fluctuations in value and entails a high degree of risk, including the
possibility of substantial losses. Private equity investments are generally illiquid, and the investment
outlook may change given the availability of credit or other financing sources. The Fund’s value is
expected to follow a J-curve, so that in the first years the Fund value is expected to be below booking
value. Generally, the Fund’s returns are generated after a period of five to seven years, when selling
the investments. Investors should have an investment horizon of at minimum 7 to 10 years.

###### Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) Fund

The Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) Fund invests globally in high-yield insurance-linked bonds
(cat bonds) whose return depends on the occurrence of specific insured events, such as natural
catastrophic events. The investments are broadly diversified across various insured risks (wind,
earthquake, wildfire, and other natural disasters) and geographic locations. Besides investments
in cat bonds, the Fund may also invest up to 30% of assets in illiquid, direct private reinsurance
contracts (collateralized reinsurance, or CRI). CRI investments are illiquid and typically cannot
be disposed of prior to their expiration (minimum investment period of one year). Because of the
nature of ILS investments, they are uncorrelated with the typical capital market risks. The issuer
and counterparty risks are fully hedged by means of risk-free collateral. The Fund is benchmarked
to the XYZ Cat Bond Index.

###### Short Duration Fund

The Short Duration Fund is a private placement fund whose objective is to provide current
income while preserving capital. The strategy primarily invests in fixed-income securities issued
or guaranteed by the US government or by its respective agencies. The Fund may also invest in
mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate debt, and
other US dollar–denominated obligations issued in the United States by non-US banks and corpo-
rations. The Fund may invest up to 10% of assets in non-investment-grade securities. A portion of
the Fund’s assets may be invested in illiquid securities that do not have a readily available market.
The Fund may invest in certain types of derivatives such as futures and options. .The principal
risks of the Fund are active management risk, market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, derivative
instruments risk, counterparty risk, extension risk, prepayment risk, and high-yield debt securities
risk. The Fund is benchmarked to the XYZ Short-Term US Government Credit Index.

###### 2018 Venture Capital Fund

The 2018 Venture Capital Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by acquiring minority inter-
ests in early-stage technology companies. The Fund invests in technology companies in Europe,

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Asia Pacific, and emerging markets. European venture investments are more concentrated than
in the other regions and are focused on a few high-quality companies. Exit opportunities include
IPOs, trade sales, and secondary sales. Opportunities in China and India will be targeted for
investment, and an allocation to Chinese high-tech will be at least 10% of the invested capital over
the Fund’s life. International venture capital investments are generally illiquid and are subject to
currency risk. If investment opportunities and/or exit strategies become limited, the life of the
fund may be extended, and capital calls and distributions may be delayed. The Fund is bench-
marked to the XYZ Venture Capital Index.

###### 2016 Buyout Strategy Fund of Funds

The 2016 Buyout Strategy Fund of Funds includes primary and secondary partnership investments
with strategies focused on leveraged and growth-oriented buyouts, primarily in the United States.
Managers of partnerships are expected to focus on reducing costs, preparing companies for down-
turn, and providing operational improvement rather than financial engineering. Investments may
be in small, medium, and large buyout partnerships, aiming to make selective commitments diver-
sifying across stages, industries, and vintage years. Secondary deals take advantage of distressed
primary partnership sales, providing access to an increased mix of assets. The underlying funds
are leveraged 100% to 300%. A leveraged fund may result in large fluctuations in value and entails
a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses. Private equity investments
are illiquid and, therefore, if investment opportunities and/or exit strategies become limited, the
Fund’s life may be extended, and capital calls and distributions may be delayed.

###### Value-Added Strategy Closed-End Real Estate Commingled Fund

The Value-Added Strategy Closed-End Real Estate Commingled Fund is managed using a
value-added investment strategy with a focus on both income and appreciation. Portfolio man-
agement intends to invest in properties located in major markets within the United States with
higher operational risk than traditional property types. The target level of leverage is 60% with a
maximum allowable level of 70%. A leveraged fund may result in large fluctuations in the value of
the fund and entails a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses. Real estate
investments are generally illiquid, and the investment outlook may change given the availability
of credit or other financing sources. If investment opportunities or exit strategies become limited,
the Fund’s life may be extended, and capital calls and distributions may be delayed.

##### Broad Distribution Pooled Fund Descriptions

###### US Fixed Income Fund

The Fund is designed to maximize total return by investing in a portfolio of investment-grade
intermediate- and long-term debt securities. The Fund will primarily invest in corporate bonds,
US Treasuries, other US government and agency securities, and asset-backed, mortgage-related,
and mortgage-backed securities. The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in bonds and up
to 20% in cash and cash equivalents. The Fund is subject to general market risk, interest rate risk,
credit (issuer and counterparty) risk, and liquidity risk. General market risk is the risk that the
value of the securities owned by the Fund may underperform because of factors affecting partic-
ular industries or securities markets generally. Interest rate risk is the risk the values of bonds will
change by changes in interest rates. If rates increase, the value of bonds declines in general. Credit
risk is the risk the value of investments may change because of changes in creditworthiness of
issuers of debt securities and default of counterparties in investment transactions. Liquidity risk is
the risk the Fund may have a loss when it sells securities to raise cash for redemption requests by
other shareholders.

###### Global Equity Market Neutral Fund

The Fund takes long and short positions in different securities, selecting from a universe of global
stocks with similar characteristics to those in the XYZ World Equity Index. The Fund purchases
securities that it believes are undervalued and sells short securities that it believes are overvalued.
The long and short positions are matched in order to limit exposure to macroeconomic factors.
Derivatives may be used as substitutes for securities in which the Fund can invest. Specific risks
include: leverage risk, which can increase market exposure and magnify losses; derivatives risk,
which is the risk that losses may be greater than investing directly in the underlying securities;
and short selling risk, which is the risk that in selling borrowed securities, the short seller may
be unable to purchase them at a price lower than the price at which they were sold, which could
result in unlimited losses. Leverage is not expected to exceed more than 200% of total net assets.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>###### Global Absolute Return Fund

The Fund seeks to provide total returns and maintain a relatively low correlation with traditional
asset classes. The Fund may buy or sell stocks and bonds across various countries and industry
sectors and applies an active currency strategy. The Fund makes use of derivatives, including
swaps, futures, and forwards, in implementing its strategies. In addition to market, interest rate,
credit, and currency risks, alternative investing may include complicated investment techniques
that could result in greater volatility and loss. The Fund may use leverage. Leverage is not expected
to exceed more than 200% of total net assets. Leverage may result in large fluctuations in the
Fund’s value and entails a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses. The
Fund uses certain derivatives that involve counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the
counterparty may fail to fulfill its obligation under the contract, resulting in losses to the Fund.
Short selling risk is the risk that securities sold short (borrowed) may rise significantly in price,
resulting in unlimited losses when purchased to close the position in the security.

###### US Small Cap Equity Fund

The Fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth by investing in US companies with market
capitalization of less than $2 billion. The Fund aims to outperform the XYZ US Small Cap Equity
Index. The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in equities of small US companies. These com-
panies are similar in size to those that constitute the bottom 20% by market capitalization of the
North American equity markets. The Fund may also invest in other equities, equivalent securities,
and cash. The Fund’s base currency is the euro. Specific risk factors include the following: The
Fund is unhedged, and changes in exchange rates could result in losses relative to the euro. Small-
cap equity prices can be more volatile than larger-cap stocks and carry more risk. In difficult mar-
ket conditions, the Fund may be unable to sell a security for full value or at all. This scenario could
affect performance and could cause the Fund to defer or suspend redemptions of its shares.

###### Global Credit Income Fund

The Global Credit Income Fund’s investment objective is to (i) provide income and capital growth
over the long term by investing in bonds issued by governments and companies globally and (ii)
invest at least two-thirds of its assets in investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds issued by
governments, government agencies, supra-nationals, and companies globally, including emerging
markets. The Fund allocates across a range of global credit sectors with a bottom-up approach
while managing duration and currency risk. The Fund targets a portfolio-weighted average dura-
tion range of three to five years. The Fund may use derivatives with the aim of achieving invest-
ment gains, portfolio efficiency, and/or reducing risk. Specific risk factors include the following:
Mortgage or asset-backed securities may not receive in full the amounts owed to them by under-
lying borrowers. The counterparty to a derivative or other contractual agreement may be unable
to honor its commitments, potentially creating a loss for the Fund. A derivative may not perform

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>as expected and may cause the Fund to lose as much or more than the amount invested. Leverage
is not expected to exceed more than 200% of total net assets. A leveraged fund may result in large
value fluctuations and entails a high degree of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses.
High-yield bonds generally carry greater market, credit, and liquidity risk. A rise in interest rates
generally causes bond prices to fall.

###### Diversified Equity Fund

The Fund aims to generate an absolute return above the UK inflation rate over an economic cycle
(typically five years) at a risk level lower than equity markets as represented by the XYZ Global
Broad Market Index (the benchmark). The Fund may invest in a broad range of asset classes
including equities, bonds, infrastructure, property, commodities, and absolute return strate-
gies. Investment in these asset classes may be made through a wide range of investment vehicles
including transferable securities, derivatives, deposits, collective investment schemes, money
market instruments, and cash. The Fund may take long and short positions in markets via deriv-
atives contracts. Specific risk factors include the following: The Fund may be concentrated in a
limited number of geographical regions, industry sectors, markets, or individual positions. This
may result in large changes in the Fund’s value, either up or down. Emerging markets generally
carry greater political, legal, counterparty, and operational risk. As infrastructure and prop-
erty assets are unlisted, the strategy is subject to liquidity risk, specifically the risk of low price
discovery and/or the ability to transact in the market freely. Derivatives carry the risk of reduced
liquidity and increased volatility in adverse market conditions. Use of derivatives will result in the
Fund being leveraged, where the potential for losses exceeds the amount invested. Leverage is not
expected to exceed more than 300% of total net assets.

###### UK Gilt Fund

The Fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth and income by investing primarily in UK gov-
ernment securities across all maturities. The Fund may also hold exposure to sterling credit bonds
and non-sterling bonds (hedged back to British pounds). The Fund targets a portfolio-weighted
average duration range of between three and six years. The Fund may use derivatives to achieve
the investment objective, reduce risk, or manage the Fund more efficiently. Specific risk factors
include the following: The counterparty to a derivative or other contractual agreement may be
unable to honor its commitments to the Fund, potentially creating a loss for the Fund. Derivatives
usage exposes the Fund to risks different from, and potentially greater than, the risks associated
with investing directly in securities and may result in additional losses, which could be greater
than the cost of the derivative. A decline in an issuer’s financial health could cause the value of its
bonds to fall or become worthless. When interest rates rise, bond values generally fall; this risk
increases the longer the investment’s maturity. Leverage is not expected to exceed more than 200%
of total net assets. A leveraged fund may result in large value fluctuations and entails a high degree
of risk, including the possibility of substantial losses.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>###### Asian High Yield Fund

The Fund invests in a diversified mix of high-yield fixed-income securities issued by Asian enti-
ties or their subsidiaries. The Fund aims to outperform the XYZ Asian High Yield Index. The
Fund applies both top-down and bottom-up investment approaches, targeting duration, credit,
and allocation. The Fund targets to be within 0.5 years (+/–) of the benchmark weighted average
duration. Securities can be denominated in US dollars as well as the various Asian currencies, and
the Fund focuses on securities rated below BBB–. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in
asset-backed, mortgage-backed, distressed, and defaulted securities, and it may invest up to 20%
in derivatives. Specific risk factors include market risks peculiar to Asian bond markets, high-yield
credit risk, structured product risk, and emerging market risk. Currency, interest rate, and credit
risks are general risk factors to consider. As a result of liquidity risk, the Fund may have a loss
when it sells securities to raise cash for redemption requests by other shareholders.

###### European Equity Fund

The Fund aims to invest in high-quality companies in well-structured, growing industries, focus-
ing on long-term growth. The Fund aims to invest in between 40 and 50 companies, outperform
its benchmark (the XYZ European Equity Index) by 250 bps to 300 bps per year, and achieve a
target tracking error of 3% to 6% per annum. In selecting investments for the Fund, the portfolio
manager considers the results of a top-down country- and sector-specific analysis while using a
fundamental bottom-up approach to stock selection relative to the benchmark. Specific risk fac-
tors include investments in illiquid securities, which include securities yet to list, IPOs, or securi-
ties undergoing corporate actions that limit trading. Especially in times of economic distress, the
Fund may incur greater losses than if the Fund had been invested in liquid securities.

###### European Bond Fund

The Fund combines a top-down and bottom-up investment process that allocates risk across sec-
tors and maturities, focused on well-diversified investment-grade Eurozone fixed-income securi-
ties. The Fund is benchmarked against the XYZ Euro Aggregate Bond Index. It aims to invest in
100 to 125 issuers to generate income and capital gains through investments predominantly in A+
and above rated corporate bonds. The Fund targets a portfolio-weighted average duration range of
between three and five years. Specific risk factors include concentration risk, sovereign risk, and
risks associated with investment in securitized debt.

###### World Allocation Fund

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in other mutual funds for
which the firm is the investment manager (“underlying funds”). The Fund is considered a “fund
of funds.” These underlying funds represent a variety of asset classes and investment styles.

<||WXb23TXrUn3Rxz00yNNr89HV||>Through investments in these underlying funds, the Fund invests in issuers from several differ-
ent countries. As a result, the Fund normally will have approximately 35% to 55% of its net assets
allocated to non-US investments, including emerging market countries. The target asset class
allocation of the Fund is 60% to equity investments, 30% to fixed-income securities and money
market instruments, and 10% to alternative investments. The portfolio management team will
rebalance the asset class allocations and Fund’s investments based on the results of a proprietary
quantitative model and continuous monitoring of market conditions. When market conditions
dictate a more defensive strategy, the Fund or an underlying fund may temporarily hold cash or
cash equivalents. In that case, the Fund’s allocated holdings may be significantly different from
its target allocations. As a result, the Fund may not achieve its investment objective. Given the
scope of the Fund, it is subject to numerous types of risks including, but not limited to, affiliated
fund risk, allocation risk, alternative investment allocation risk, counterparty risk, derivatives risk,
equity security risk, fixed-income security risk, foreign exposure risk, quantitative model risk, and
sovereign debt risk. For more information concerning the underlying funds of this Fund and their
respective risks, please request a current prospectus.
